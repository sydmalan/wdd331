        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
          This course provides deeper learning into topics in cascading style
          sheets (CSS). Topics of study will include: complex CSS selectors,
          advanced CSS layout and positioning techniques, CSS transitions and
          animations, CSS Preprocessing, an introduction to CSS libraries, and
          using scalable vector graphics (SVG) with HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
        <p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Solve problems through independent study and application—learn how
            to learn.
          </li>
          <li>Demonstrate a mastery of CSS.</li>
          <li>
            Understand the role of CSS preprocessors and how to effectively
            integrate their use in development workflows.
          </li>

          <li>
            Work effectively within a team by teaching and learning
            collaboratively, communicating clearly, fulfilling assignments and
            meeting deadlines.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Notice Outcome One...learn how to learn. It's placement at the
          beginning of the list is intentional. CSS and how it is applied in the
          creation of websites is still evolving and changing. The most
          important thing you can take from this class is the improved ability
          to learn new things so that you can stay current as technologies
          change. The structure of the course reflects the importance of outcome
          one.
        </p>

        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>
          Students should have completed WDD 230 (CIT 230 or CS 213) before
          taking this course.

        <p>
          You may be looking at weeks 5-12 and wondering why there are no topics
          set. Remember outcome one above? There are certain topics that are
          critical that you gain some knowledge of. We will study those in weeks
          1-4. After that the course will change and adapt to what the class
          decides they would like to study next.
        </p>
        <p>
          The web is a rapidly evolving platform. CSS changes regularly and the
          ways that it is used in building web sites change as well. Over the
          first few weeks of the semester you will be asked to pay close
          attention to every website you visit. Take note of anything that
          catches your attention. You are looking for things that the builder of
          the site has done that you think are cool and that you would be
          interested in learning how to replicate. Essentially anything that
          causes you to think "I wonder how they did that?" should get recorded.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the end of week 3 you should contribute 2-3 of your favorite
          examples. Try to find different types of examples, ie:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Layouts that you think are unique or clever</li>
          <li>A reusable component (a part of a page)</li>
          <li>Animations</li>
          <li>A creative take on a form or form input.</li>
          <li>etc...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In week 4, after all of the examples are submitted, the list will be
          curated and we will decide which ones we want to try and learn how to
          duplicate. We will spend anywhere from a few days to up to three weeks
          on each example that we choose. We will work through weeks 5-12 of the
          course completing as many as we can.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What if we miss an important topic?" you may be asking yourself.
          Well, we probably will :) There is not enough time to learn everything
          we could on the topic of CSS. This format will allow us to prioritize
          what is important for you right NOW while helping you become better at
          picking up the rest of it later as needed. The course is also
          repeatable so you can come back again for more!
        </p>
        <p>
          As we begin working on the examples it is important to remember a few
          things:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The purpose of these exercises is to <strong>learn</strong>. Do not
            let concerns about doing it wrong or right get in the way of your
            learning.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your instructor should provide initial help in deconstructing the
            problem and identifying topics you may need to study in order to be
            successful. Some resources will be provided, others you will be
            expected to find on your own. When you find a good helpful resource
            <strong>please share it with your classmates!</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Be prepared to <span class="strike">fail</span>
            <em>have our goals and expectations change</em>. We may not succeed
            in replicating each example we attempt. This is ok as long as we
            learn something from each attempt.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>
          You will spend your time throughout the week researching, learning,
          and doing your best to meet our goals on the current example. Each
          week you will also be asked to complete a reflection assignment.
          Please take this seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
          This reflection will ask about what you learned that impacted you,
          what questions you still have on the topic, and what resources you
          found where you might be able to answer those questions. You will also
          use the reflection to ask for specific feedback from the instructor.
          These reflections will be worth 30% of your final grade.
        </p>
        <h3>Website Examples</h3>
        <p>
          Each time we begin a new example we will set a due date. Each example
          that we attempt will be accompanied by some goals. Sometimes the goal
          will be to duplicate the example exactly, other times it might be to
          learn a technique and adapt it. You may or may not be asked to turn in
          your finished example attempts. (Your instructor will discuss this
          with you) Regardless you should take all the work you complete this
          semester and compile it into a portfolio. This portfolio can be used
          at anytime by you to request feedback from the instructor, and will
          certainly be used at the end of the semester as part of the final
          grade determination.
        </p>

        <h3>Final Project</h3>
        <p>
          There will be a final project that will be completed as a small group
          (2-3 members) over the course of the semester.
        </p>
        <p>
          The assignment will be to create a version of the
          <a href="http://csszengarden.com" target="_blank">CSS Zen Garden</a>
          (http://csszengarden.com) Each group will be responsible to decide
          upon a theme, then design and build their version according to the
          rules of the Zen Garden.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students will self-select into groups of 2-3 during the first few
          weeks of the semester. You will want to try and find others who
          complement your strengths. Ideally you will be able to finish the
          project with the same group you started with, but this is not
          required. You must however participate in each portion and will be
          responsible to bring yourself up to speed quickly with the new group
          if you switch.
        </p>

        <h3>Self Evaluation</h3>
        <p>
          At midterm and again at the end of the semester you will be asked to
          complete a self evaluation of how you are progressing toward the
          <a href="#">outcomes</a> of the course. Your portfolio will be used by
          the instructor to validate your self evaluations and give feedback.
          This will account for the other 70% of your grade. This can be done in
          one of two ways:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The student can schedule a meeting with the instructor for a
            synchronous (face-to-face or online) meeting. This is done as an
            interview where the student offers a claim of mastery, and the
            instructor challenges as needed. The student should answer the
            challenges by showing examples of their work that they feel justify
            their claim.
          </li>
          <li>
            The student can prepare a short video of themselves giving their
            self-evaluation along with examples of the work they have completed
            over the semester that back up their claims. The links to the work
            should be submitted with the review as a portfolio.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Your instructor will inform you which method will be used for your
          section.
        </p>
        <p>
          The finished Zen Garden project should play an important role in the
          validation of your self-evaluation on the outcomes that you complete.
          You should be prepared to talk about which parts of the project you
          contributed to and what you learned.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <a href="#">outcomes</a> will be evaluated according to the
          following scale:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Mastery (4)</dt>
          <dd>
            represents outstanding understanding, application, and integration
            of subject material and extensive evidence of original thinking,
            skillful use of concepts, and ability to analyze and solve complex
            problems.
          </dd>
          <dt>Proficient (3)</dt>
          <dd>
            represents considerable/significant understanding, application, and
            incorporation of the material which would prepare a student to be
            successful in next level courses, graduate school or employment.
          </dd>
          <dt>Developing (2)</dt>
          <dd>
            represents sufficient understanding of subject matter. The student
            demonstrates minimal initiative to be prepared for class. Sequenced
            courses could be attempted, but mastering new materials might prove
            challenging.
          </dd>
          <dt>Unsatisfactory (1)</dt>
          <dd>
            represents poor performance and initiative to learn and understand
            and apply course materials. Retaking a course or remediation may be
            necessary to prepare for additional instruction in this subject
            matter.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <hr>
        <p>
          At the end of the semester the final evaluation scores for each
          objective will be averaged and a grade assigned according to the
          following grade scale.
        </p>
        <h3>Grade Scale</h3>
        <ul class="mono">
          <li>A: 3.5 - 4</li>
          <li>B: 2.5 - 3.4</li>
          <li>C: 1.5 - 2.4</li>
          <li>F: &lt; 1.5</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Overall Grading</h2>
        <p>
          The final percentage will be a combination of the self-evaluation
          score (70%) plus the weekly reflection score (30%). The following
          grade scale will determine your grade:
        </p>
        <ul class="mono">
          <li><b>A</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;93.00%-100%</li>
          <li><b>A-</b>&nbsp; 90.00%-92.99%</li>
          <li><b>B+&nbsp;</b>87.00%-89.99%</li>
          <li><b>B</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;83.00%-86.99%</li>
          <li><b>B-</b>&nbsp; 80.00%-82.99%</li>
          <li><b>C+</b> 77.00%-79.99%</li>
          <li><b>C</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;73.00%-76.99%</li>
          <li><b>C-</b>&nbsp; 70.00%-72.99%</li>
          <li><b>D</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;60.00%-69.99%</li>
          <li><b>F</b>&nbsp; &nbsp; below 60%</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Standards</h2>
        <p>
          Be responsible for your own education. Take responsibility to complete
          your homework as assigned. Be prepared to accept the consequences if
          you do not.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>It is important that you prepare yourself each week to contribute
            actively in learning with your fellow students. Be respectful of
            each other’s time and be prompt to any meetings that may be
            scheduled.</em>
